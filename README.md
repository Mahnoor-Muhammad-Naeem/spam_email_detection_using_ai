# SPAM EMAIL DETECTION USING AI:

For my 6th semester Artificial Intelligence course, I along with my senior group member, developed a Spam Email Detection system as our semester project. The system used Python, Tkinter for the frontend, and scikit-learn for machine learning, employing algorithms like Logistic Regression and SVM. I applied TF-IDF, N-grams, and bag-of-words for feature extraction on a dataset of 5000 emails. The project evaluated model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score, and addressed challenges such as imbalanced data and evolving spam techniques.
